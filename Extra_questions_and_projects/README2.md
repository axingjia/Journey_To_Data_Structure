1. In chapter 1, Modify the orderedArray.java program (Listing 2.4) so that the insert() and delete() routines, as well as find(), use a binary search, as suggested in the text.

2. In Chapter 2 about array, Add a merge() method to the OrdArray class in the orderedArray.java program (Listing 2.4) so that you can merge two ordered source arrays into an ordered destination array. Write code in main() that inserts some random numbers into the two source arrays, invokes merge(), and displays the contents of the resulting destination array. The source arrays may hold different numbers of data items. In your algorithm you will need to compare the keys of the source arrays, picking the smallest one to copy to the destination. You’ll also need to handle the situation when one source array exhausts its contents before the other.

3. In Chapter 2 about array, Write a noDups() method for the HighArray class of the highArray.java program (Listing 2.3). This method should remove all duplicates from the array. That is, if three items with the key 17 appear in the array, noDups() should remove two of them. Don’t worry about maintaining the order of the items. One approach is to first compare every item with all the other items and overwrite any duplicates with a null (or a distinctive value that isn’t used for real keys). Then remove all the nulls. Of course, the array size will be reduced.
